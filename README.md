# VersionControl
Application that allows users to send/receive files from a server.

As both applications use features like std::filesystem, please ensure that you build/run the solution with the C++ Language Standard
set to at least C++17.

Due to the nature of storing/sending files, to fully test the client it must be run from the project directory (from within Visual Studio).
If you run it from the .exe in the debug folder, it will run, but it will not be able to see any of the files that it can send/receive.

****************************************************
1. Open both the Server and Client solution files
2. Run the server first
3. Once the server is running, you can now run the client (currently the client needs to be run from within the IDE)
4. Follow the onscreen menu options
